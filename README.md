# Olympic-Dataset-GUI

## Overview
This GUI allows the user to access a public dataset obtained from Kaggle, "120 Years of Olympic History: Athletes and Results". In this application, the user can filter and view the dataset according to five different cateogries: sex, age, country, sport, and year. This program was originally completed as an assignment for a Programming module in Electronic & Electronic Engineering at UCL. This assignment was further developed and improved as a personal project to convert the original console-based application to a GUI one, and include better error handling. 

The original assignment included the ability to plot the weights of athletes from the filtered dataset, which has been omitted from the GUI version. 

The csv file used in this application is a shortened version of the bigger dataset, since all the data is not used in the original. 

The original assignment is available for comparison. 

## Further Improvements To Be Made
1. Add image in the home page
2. Include the graph plotting from original
3. Use ttk module for more modern look
